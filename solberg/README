This is a copy of the phenotype data from a rat cross performed by
Dr. Leah Solberg and colleagues.

A reciprocal intercross of rat strain Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and Fisher
344 (F344) was generated to identify quantitative trait locus (QTL)
for depression-like behavior traits. The F2 generation was subjected
to the forced swim test (FST) to measure the time of immobility,
climbing and swimming. For detailed protocols, see Solberg et
al. 2004.
