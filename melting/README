The data are from an ice melting experiment done by me and my son for
his school's science fair.

The goal is to examine if ice or sugar affect the melting of ice
cubes, and if so, to what degree.

We placed ice cubes on plates (one cube per plate.  We considered
three treatments: salt (1 teaspoon), sugar (1 teaspoon), and control
(nothing).  Then we waited till the cubes were fully melted. 

In trial runs of the experiment we found out that the weight of the
ice cubes, the ambient temperature, and the plates on which the ice
cubes were placed seemed to affect melting.  It is also possible that
the placement of the cubes on our dining table affects melting.

Two kinds of plates were used -- steel and ceramic.  We arrayed them
in 3 rows and 4 columns on our dining table (12 cubes per run).  In
the first two runs, we had one of each treatment in each column, and
randomizing the treatments per column.  In the third run, we
randomized both treatments and plates with two of each treatment-plate
pair in the experiment.
