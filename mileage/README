These are fuel mileage records from three cars.  The trip odometer was
zeroed every time the gas tank was filled (till the auto shutoff went
off).  The miles traveled and gallons filled was recorded.  Mileage
was calculated by dividing miles traveled by gallons filled.  For two
of the three cars, the car dashboard indicated a gas mileage number.
